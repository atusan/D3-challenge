## Project Description
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml. The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

While the ticks on the axes allow us to infer approximate values for each circle, it's impossible to determine the true value without adding another layer of data. 

Enter tooltips: developers can implement these in their D3 graphics to reveal a specific element's data when the user hovers their cursor over the element.

Use the d3-tip.js plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged)

This plugin is already included in this assignment directory.
